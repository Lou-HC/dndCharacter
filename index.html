    Lorelei Alcidibias, often called 'Lorry', 20 years of age at the time of [insert inciting incident]. She was born to Emayn and Dives in the town of Vindkilde. She was born into a semi-aristocratic lifestyle, not having to worry about her next meal or the roof over her head. She always had a bit of adventure in her soul. This feeling was not recuperated by her home's lifestyle. But, at the age of 13, she heard that her older sister, Simile, was leaving to go on an adventure, Lorry needed to join her. She begged and pleaded with her older sister for 48 straight hours.
</div>
<div class="RandomLeft">
    During this time, the sisters met lots of different creatures. For the first time in their lives, they met people of races other than elves or humans. They met dwarfs, half-lings, dragon-born and most interestingly: Tieflings. Lorry was fascinated by them. The first taste of adventure she got was the sight of tiefling, a woman named [Insert Name]. Lorry was utterly perplexed by the sight of a tiefling, but she was more intrigued than anything. She developed a liking for tieflings and their charisma, which still stands today.
