    Lorelei Alcidibias, often called 'Lorry', 20 years of age at the time of [insert inciting incident]. She was born to Emayn and Dives in the town of Vindkilde. She was born into a semi-aristocratic lifestyle, not having to worry about her next meal or the roof over her head. She always had a bit of adventure in her soul. This feeling was not recuperated by her home's lifestyle. But, at the age of 13, she heard that her older sister, Simile, was leaving to go on an adventure, Lorry needed to join her. She begged and pleaded with her older sister for 48 straight hours.
</div>
<div class="RandomLeft">
    During this time, the sisters met lots of different creatures. For the first time in their lives, they met people of races other than elves or humans. They met dwarfs, half-lings, dragon-born and most interestingly: Tieflings. Lorry was fascinated by them. The first taste of adventure she got was the sight of tiefling, a woman named [Insert Name]. Lorry was utterly perplexed by the sight of a tiefling, but she was more intrigued than anything. She developed a liking for tieflings and their charisma, which still stands today.

        <h3 class="SubclassHead">Hypnotic Stare</h3>
        <p>
            At 3rd you can use your bonus action and one bardic inspiration die to stare at a creature that you can see within 60ft that can see you. That creature has disadvantage in Wisdom savings throws against your spells for 1 minute or untill you stare at another creature, the creature dies, you and the creature are more than 60ft apart or you fall unconscious or die. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of each of the creature's turns, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your save DC. On a successful save, the effect ends.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creatures under the effect of your stare don't know that they are being stared at or under the effect unless you allow it. Creatures tht can't be charmed are immune to this effect.
        </p>
        <h3 class="SubclassHead">Towering Ego</h3>

        <p>
            At 14th level, you can use an action to force a humanoid creature under the effect of your <i>Hypnotic Stare</i> to make a Wisdom Saving throw. On a failed save, the creature a thrall(<i>As per the Dominate Person spell</i>) under your control for the next hour.The creature remains enthralled untill you or your allies attack or damage it, you successfully use this feature agian or you die.
        </p>

            Unlike the common bards, a bard of hte College of Nightmares does not have it's relying on beauty, poetry or inspiring performances, but rather they are sad and disturbing creatures. Their power to infiltrate a creature's mind searching for traumatic memories of the victim and twisting them has made these bards the worst enemy of regretful people.

            Babadook
        </h3>
    <p>
        When you join the College of Nightmares at 3rd level, you gain a pocket book named Babadook that is mostly used to write traumatic memories of regretful creatures. In addition, you have advantage on charisma checks to interact with a creature that you have knowledge of a traumatic memory of it's past
    </p>
    <h3 class="SubclassHead" id="Plum">Twisted Memory</h3>
    <p>
        At 3rd,you learn the Detect thoughts spell and this does not count against your spells knows limit. As a bonus action, you can use one bardic inspiration die to probe deeper into the affected creature's mind, searching for a traumatic memory. If the creature fails a Wisdom Saving throw, it suffers the roll of you bardic inspiration mutiplied by your proficiency bonus as psychic damage, as it is tortured by the traumatic memory that you have distorted to an even worse one. <br>
         Moreover, once you are successful in finding a traumatic memory, you can use your bonus action to shift your attention to another creture's mind. Each one of the traumatic memories are registered in your Babadook and you can't have more than one register of a single creature.
    </p>
    <h3 class="SubclassHead" id="Plum">Recall Agony</h3>
    <p>
        At 6th level, you learn to use your knowledge of creature's past traumas to weaken their will. When you cast a spell with a verbal component that forces one or more creatures to make an Int, Wis or Cha saving throw, you may utter a spooky phrase related to one affected creature. When you do so, the creature gains disadvantage on the saving throw and suffers from one of the following madness effects along with the spell's effect untill your next round. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After you use this feature, the spooky phrase dissapears from your Babadook. A creature immue to being frightend is immune to this effect.

        In addition, whenever a creature is under your <i>Detect Thoughts</i> spell, it loses all resistance or immunities to the frightend condition and psychic damage.
    </p>

        Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving throw against this effect, you can't use this feature again untill you finish a long rest.
